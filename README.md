# IPL Calculator 

[This](https://github.com/ayushjain01/IPL-Calculator/blob/master/predict_points.py) project (currently) calculates the chances of Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) qualifying for the playoffs of the Indian Premier League (IPL) based on various scenarios. It also prints the points table for every scenario. Checkout [output.txt](output.txt) to view a sample output of this script.
 
## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the script, you need to have Python 3.11.x installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## ðŸ“Œ Note

This script manually assigns the net run rate (NRR) value after every game as +- 0.05 which is not accurate. A better approach would be to calculate the actual NRR based on the runs scored and conceded by each team in every match. This will be added in future updates.

## ðŸ”® Future Plans

Soon, I plan to create a full-fledged web application that will scrape the IPL official website to get details of upcoming matches and store previous match data and automatically predict match winners and provide the results. This webapp will also allow users to predict the winners and compare their results with the actual outcomesðŸ’»
